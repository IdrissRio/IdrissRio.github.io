### About me!
My name is Idriss Riouak and I am a PhD Student working under the advisment of Prof. GÃ¶rel Hedin, Prof. Christoph Reichenbach and Dr. Niklas Fors at Lund University. 
My research work is generously funded by the Wallenberg Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP), funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. 

My research focuses on static analysis, with emphasis on control-flow and dataflow analysis. I have a browad interest in compiler constructions and formal methods.
